    <p> its midnight at 2am i don't have anything to think off, i have nothing to do even opening social media(s), playing games doesn't cure this boredom and this feeling off that i have it bothers me, something is really missing, my heart thinks about you but my mind thinks about what am i supposed to do and how can i not think about you... theres something feels off inside of me, something tiredness that even sleep can't satisfy it at all.. something's missing, something part of me died... your presence lingers in my mind.. kahit subukan ko na libangin sarili ko sa kahit anong bagay i don't have interest to anything at all but watching movie sometimes do its thing.. para hindi ako malungkot or to not think of you temporarily it'll start to feel heavy if i think more of it i have some urge that i really want you sometines.. your hugs and kisses, your voice everything about you i missed it i don't have high hopes but i'm holding to that 1% i hope you're doing well and sleeping well today, make sure you always have enough sleep.. i hope you did well in your exams, always do your best because as long as i'm in here i will be always proud of you xD i miss you and i love you

(i'd rather have these bad moment of us than choosing another person to be with.. figuring out how to work this out again than trying again with someone new, because we are really capable of being together we just have somme flaws that needs to improve.. but its okay we're still learning nasa young age palang tayo right? we're still learning the meaning of love and how to love.. i hope we'll be better for each other someday..
